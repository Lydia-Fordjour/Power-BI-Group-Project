Understanding Car-Buying Trends: A Data-Driven Exploration
As a group, we set out to explore the reasons why people buy cars. Is it for convenience, fashion, or simply a hobby? 
Through this visualization, you’ll discover that car buyers consider various factors such as color, engine type, and transmission (manual vs. automatic) before making a purchase.

One surprising insight was that many people still prefer manual cars—but why? Is it for control, cost-effectiveness, or driving experience?

We also investigated whether a person's salary influences their car choices. Interestingly, our biggest discovery was that the most expensive car was not bought by the highest-earning individual.

Dive into this project to uncover fascinating insights into car-buying behavior and what truly matters to buyers!
